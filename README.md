## Inspiration
How can we make navigating the city of Chicago safer?

- ~20% of students walk to school every morning
- Total Violent Crimes in Chicago: 904
- Sun-Times counted 241 homicides this year
- Chicago Tribune reported that CPD solved one in every 20 shootings

## What it does
- Give people the tools to make data-driven decisions!
- Highlight routes/areas in a commute that may be dangerous
- Pull info from social media about crimes that are happening in real-time
- People can post in real-time about the crimes in the city

## How it was built
- Chicago Data Portal
- Twitter API
- Heroku
- Flask (Python)
- Flutter (Dart)
- Google Maps API
- Twilio API
- Flutter Bloc + Bloc (State Management)
